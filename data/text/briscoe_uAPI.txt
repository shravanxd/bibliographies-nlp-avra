INTRODUCTION
Over five thousand autobiographies have been published since 1945. More appear in print each week, and during the last decade reader interest has increased considerably. Some readers have been drawn to autobiography because they perceive individual life stories as authentic and compelling. Others seek escape through fanta- sies of unique or unusual experience. Faced by the confusion of modern life, both general and scholarly readers have turned to the voice of personal experience in order to better understand contemporary culture. Scholars in many humanistic fields (e.g., American Studies, Literature, Women's Studies, Black Studies, and Social History) have begun to recognize autobiography as a significant historical resource as well as an important art form. As Albert E. Stone wrote in 1972, the exploration of autobiog- raphy has become "one of the striking and promising developments in recent Ameri- can studies" because of the "wealth of cultural information quite literally unparalleled in other sources."1
This bibliography provides access to over 5,000 American autobiographies published in book form by private and commercial presses from 1945 through 1980. It serves as a companion volume to the only other major reference work in this area, A Bibliography of American Autobiographies (The University of Wisconsin Press, 1962), by Louis Kaplan, which includes about 6,000 autobiographies published before 1945.
Autobiography is defined broadly in this volume to include the following:
. memoirs, diaries, journals, and collections of letters;
. nonfiction works containing a substantial portion of autobiographical writing;
. alleged autobiographical works employing a ghost writer or amanuensis;
. works by American authors who have lived in a foreign country;
. works by foreign authors who have lived in the United States for a considerable time.
In order to provide continuity with Kaplan's work, autobiographies published before 1945 which have since been reprinted and those published before 1945 (excluding diaries, private journals, and collections of letters) which were not cited in Kaplan's work have been included.
The bibliography does not include autobiographies published in books of gene- alogy, manuscripts, newspapers, or periodicals, nor does it include works known to be spurious. Works published after 1980, as well as those published previously but identi- fied after the compilation phase of the project, are being noted and recorded for future supplements.

Methodology and Procedures
Because autobiography has historically had limited cataloging controls, the first task was to determine the most efficient means of identifying autobiographies cited in existing resources tools. Two major problems emerged. First, many resources tools do not distinguish between autobiography and biography. For example, The Library of Congress Subject Headings and The Cumulative Book Index list autobiography and biography together and rarely list autobiographical works under the class of Autobiog- raphy in a specific subject heading. Secondly, autobiography is often catalogued ac- cording to the author's occupation or central interest. In short, the subject headings under which autobiographies may be listed are as diversified as their authors.
Some autobiographies could be identified in specialized bibliographies such as H.V. Ribalow, Autobiographies of American Jews (1965), which contains selections from autobiographies by twenty-five Jews active in public life, 1880-1920; Russell Brigano, Black Americans in Autobiography (1974), containing 300 entries with annotations; and Carolyn Rhodes, Editor, Mary Louise Briscoe and Ernest Rhodes, Associate Editors, First Person Female, a supplement to American Notes and Queries (1980), containing about 300 reviews of autobiographies by American women living after 1950.
After reviewing the available resources, it was determined that for the purposes of this project, the most inclusive reference for autobiographies was Biography Index, which has been consecutively published since January 1946, and lists a variety of biographic materials. The initial author-title list was compiled after a thorough review of each volume of Biography Index, 1946-1980. This list was then refined and ex- panded by comparing it with other specialized bibliographies; with new, rare, and used book catalogs over a five-year period; with current reviews, including those in Book Review Digest and Library Journal; and with the Library of Congress MARC (Machine Readable Catalog) for autobiographies published since 1968.
The resulting author-title list was used only to determine which works were actually autobiographical. Each volume was then reviewed to insure the accuracy of the citations and to derive information for the annotations and the analytic subject index.
The citation elements, subject entries, and annotations for each autobiography were recorded on a work sheet in a standardized form. The data was then encoded in machine-sensible form and computer-processed to create the main entry section and the Subject Index. Following the editing of the computer-generated text, the machine- sensible files were coded for computerized typesetting to produce camera-ready copy of the entire Bibliography.
Entry Format
Each main entry may include the following:
. Main entry number
. Woman author indication (*)
• Author entry
. Author's birth-death dates

. Publication title and subtitle
. Joint authors, collaborative authors, and/or editors
. Edition indication
. Imprint data
Place of publication
Publisher
Date of publication or copyright
. Collation
Pagination
Index
. Annotation
Main Entry Number. The main entries have been numbered sequentially. These numbers appear to the left of the first line of the entry and are presented in bold face type. They also serve as reference points in the Subject Index.
Women Author Indication. For ease of reference, women authors have been designated with an asterisk (*) preceding the author entry.
Author Entry. Generally, the author's name has been displayed in the tradi- tional format of surname, forename, and middle name or initial. In those instances when an author's pseudonym has been employed on the title page of the work, it has been utilized as the author entry, but usually pseudonyms appear in parenthesis following the author's name. All pseudonyms have been cross-referenced with the original name of the author in the main entry list.
Birth-Death Dates. The birth and death dates for an author have been provided when possible. When only the death date was available, it has been noted with a lower case "d", e.g., d. 1955. A birth date followed only by a hyphen indicates that the author is known to be or may be assumed to be living, e.g., 7922-. Authors born before 1 890 have been presumed to be dead even if no death date was available and their birth date has been noted with a lower case "b", e.g., b. 1826.
Publication Title and Subtitle. The complete title and subtitle of the work as it appears on the title page has been provided.
Joint Authors, Collaborative Authors, and/or Editors. Joint authors noted on the title page of the work have been cross-referenced alphabetically in the main entry list (e.g., A Philosophical Correspondence by John Dewey and Arthur F. Bentley is listed by the first author, Dewey; Bentley is listed by name only, with a cross-reference to Dewey). Collaborative authors, ghost writers, and editors are not cross-referenced.
XI

Edition Indication. Special editions of series have been noted when appropriate (e.g., Private Edition, Revised Edition, 5th Edition, or Eyewitness Accounts of the Revolution).
Imprint Data. Full names of publishers have been listed for ease of reference. Every attempt was made to locate and analyze the most recent edition. In the case of reprints and revised editions, the earliest edition has been given subse- quently in parentheses. If both editions were by the same publisher, only the date of the earliest edition has been given in parenthesis.
Collation. Only Arabic pagination of a work has been noted. If the work contains an index, it has been indicated. In most cases, multi-volume works have been cited in one entry, following the Library of Congress format. How- ever, when multi-volume works have different unnumbered titles and different publication dates, they have been listed as separate entries. Because computer searches on systems such as OCLC have made location more convenient for individual users, library locations have not been listed.
Annotation. Each annotation includes the occupation of the author, the major focus of the autobiography, primary geographic locations, and important per- sonal or historic events in the author's life. In general, the annotative style employed has been objective. However, some judgments have been made as to the quality and tone of the individual work.
Subject Index
A major component of the book, the extensive analytic Subject Index includes over 50,000 entries which will enable readers to locate autobiographies related to their diverse interests. It will be stored on computer tape and has the capability for specific subject searches.
The Subject Index includes references to important personal experience and lifestyle (e.g., family life, country life, immigration, illness, death); historic events (e.g., Depression — 1929, World War II); historic periods (e.g., Colonial Period, McCarthy Era, The Sixties); significant friends and colleagues; occupation (e.g., artist, wife, executive); time of life described (e.g., childhood, old age); ethnic background; reli- gious background; geographic locations (e.g., by country, state, city or region).
The Subject Index does not repeat the author-title entries listed in the Bibliog- raphy. It does not replicate the indexes of individual volumes; it does include whatever is most prominent in each volume. If, for instance, a prominent event is mentioned in an autobiography, it will not appear in the Subject Index unless it has an important function in the author's narrative. The Subject Index does not attempt to be encyclope- dic, but to reflect those topics central to the lives of its authors. Its design evolved as the work on the project progressed. Its shape and content reflect the major concerns of American readers during the last thirty years.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The idea for this bibliography evolved from my attempts to locate contempo- rary American autobiographies for several research projects that interested me in 1973. I soon realized how inadequate existing resources were for locating autobiogra- phies. Except for Louis Kaplan's Bibliography of American Autobiographies (1962) which included works published before 1945, there was no central reference. My first debt, then, is to Kaplan, whose work became something of a model for mine.
Over the years, many have assisted me in various ways. Peggy Batten, then Bibliographer for the English Department at the University of Pittsburgh, encouraged me in the early years of the project, especially in generating ideas for the scope and function of the Subject Index. Beverly Florey worked with me through the painstaking process of extracting probable items from Biography Index for the initial author-title list. H. David Brumble III shared his notes and enthusiasm as his own project, An Annotated Bibliography of American Indian and Eskimo Autobiographies (University of Nebraska Press, 1981), developed.
Marilyn DeMario, Kathryn Flannery, Mary Robertson, and Leslie Tobias pro- vided research assistance. Janice Oliver's help went far beyond the call of secretarial duty, with typing assistance from Debra Faggioli and Pat Renkiewicz. Robert Gale generously assisted in the copy-editing of the entire text.
About sixty percent of the books were located in the University of Pittsburgh's Hillman Library and Carnegie Public Library of Pittsburgh. Ingrid T. Glasco and Suzanne B. Crosby were especially helpful in obtaining hundreds of books through Hillman Library's Interlibrary Loan Service. Many more were analyzed at the Library of Congress.
Barbara Tobias, University of Pittsburgh, who joined the project in 1979, helped with many aspects of the book — with innumerable research questions, with book location and analysis, with the design of the Subject Index, and with final text editing. Her help and support have been invaluable.
Lynn Z. Bloom, College of William and Mary, joined the project in late 1979 to assist in analyzing books; she was also responsible for initiating the author-title list for 1975-1980. Her student research assistants included Gerald Berdan, Sheila Core, Michael d'Orso, Nancy Fitch, Wendy Gilmer, Donna Hulsey, Maureen Orton, Elsa Travisano, Lana Whited, Midge Stocker and Lisa Seidman. Berna Heyman and Carol Linton of Swem Library, College of William and Mary, were helpful in locating books in Virginia libraries, including Virginia Commonwealth University, Old Dominion University, University of Virginia, and the Richmond Public Library. The College of William and Mary gave Lynn Z. Bloom a Minor Research Grant in 1981.

The computer programs were designed and supervised by Eleanor Dym, Asso- ciate Director of the Knowledge Availability Systems Center, University of Pittsburgh. Mary H. Paul was responsible for the computer text-editing, assisted by Mary E. Koller and Nadine M. Green.
The Provost's Research Development Fund, University of Pittsburgh, awarded me three grants (1974-76) which were essential for the development of this project, especially for the identification and location of the initial author-title list.
The Research Resources Program of the National Endowment for the Human- ities provided the major financial support for completing the book (1979-1982).

He writes from his perspective as Croatian immigrant, partly insider, partly outsider. He provides a humanistic interpretation of the communist and socialist move- ments, of labor leaders John L. Lewis and Harry Bridges, of Roosevelt's New Deal, and of a multitude of other people, great and small, who contributed to the social fabric.

Adams, of the quintessential New England "first family," analyzes the lifelong process of his education, formal and informal, psychological, moral, and intellectual. Burdened with familial precedent to become a statesman, Adams followed his own bent as the interpreter rather than the maker of American history. This work is among the classics of American autobiography, its most widely acclaimed chapter being "The Dynamo
and the Virgin."

Samuel Francis DuPont, Rear Admiral of the U.S. Navy during the Civil War, "played a major part in planning the blockades of the Confed- eracy and later commanded the squadron which explored tnat operation on the South Atlantic coast." Although he was notably victorious at Port Royal, the ironclads under his command at Charleston were defeated and he was blamed for the failure, relieved of command, and died in shame soon afterward. This enormous collection of his letters is intended, in part, to show that "he acted against his better judgment" at Charleston and to rehabilitate his reputation.

Ervin, chairman of the Senate Select Committee to investigate the Watergate break-in and cover-up during 1973 and 1974, was moved to write this book as a corrective to Nixon's Memoirs, which he sees as self-serving and inaccurate. Ervin presents incontrovertible evidence that Nixon and his staff (Haldeman, Ehrlichman, Dean, et al. — all of whom were convicted and imprisoned) were guilty of violating the Constitution and that Nixon would have been impeached and convicted if he hadn't resigned. Ervin amply contradicts Nixon's claim that he was hounded from office by a hostile press. The author's candor, respect for the Consti- tution, and patriotism are evident on every page.

Way of the cross — where it led me: the story of a Franciscan nun. Illus- 56 p. trated. Mountain View, California: Pacific Press Publishing Ass'n., 1977.
Fahrner describes the piety of her more than fifty years as a Franciscan nun who taught in a Catholic school. She lovingly fulfilled the rules governing her conduct — "poverty, chastity, and obedience," but approves the loosening of the severe restrictions under which she had lived as a young nun (chaperoned half-day visits to parents every three to five years). Her contented narrative does not prepare readers for her sudden conversion to Seventh Day Adventism at age seventy.

Memories and reveries: a physician's philosophical review of eight decades. New York: Exposition Press, 1958. 153 p.
Jackson's chapters follow his train of thought rather than chronology, as informal prose intermingles anecdotes of rural boyhood activities such as hunting and fishing with his views on "time," "fate and destiny," "egocentricity," and religious faith. He barely alludes to his career as a physician.

It is the second life, the life in the streets that leads to Soledad prison and a charge of murder. In the letters that follow expressing his anger and frustration and chronicling prison abuse, Jackson does not look for excuses, but the finger he points is directed at what he sees as a racist society in which Black men and women must rebel or be destroyed.

There's a rhino in the rose bed, Mother. And Jock Leslie-Melville. Gar- den City, New York: Doubleday & Co., Inc., 1973. 253 p.

A playboy in his younger days, Stewart seems to have had a constant stream of lucky breaks, good contacts through Exeter and Yale acquaintances, and an inborn knowledge of how to get ahead.

I had not expected to encounter so many people or to get the little inside glimpses that I've had, but wherever
there are human beings there are the little histories."

Although written in first person, Storey's experiences as bulldozer-driver-turned-Pentecostal evangelist were apparently set down after his death in a plane crash.

Strainchamps writes humorously on the origins and effects of her Ozark Missouri dialect ("you'uns," "cain't"), how she shed it for stan- dard English and eventually became a successful professional writer, ever aware of the subtleties of language and the discrepancies between spoken and written versions of the same words.

My world of birds: memoirs of an ornithologist. Illustrated. Philadelphia: Dorrance, 1979. 345 p.
Wallace's fascination with birds is evident from annual lists he made as a teenager in Vermont to his round-the-world explorations in search of exotic species. He describes his studies and years as a professor at Michi- gan State, intervening stints as warden of a wildlife sanctuary in Massa- chusetts, and caretaker of a mountain lodge in Vermont while undertak- ing a study of Bicknell's gray-cheeked thrush. The real stars of the show, however, are the birds themselves. Bird lists are appended to almost every chapter, and his descriptions of bird expeditions are scientifically detailed.

POPism: the Warhol '60's. And Pat Hackett. Illustrated. New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1980. 310 p. Index.
Warhol namedrops his way through the Pop 1960's — the art exhibits and hip parties, drugs and casual decadence are interspersed with exact recall of contemporary fashions and music. Warhol's Campbell's Soup Can and Marilyn Monroe paintings put him in the artistic vanguard, and his underground films and the "happenings" at the factory (his studio) helped set trends for the 60's counter culture. The fast and loose times changed abruptly when Warhol was senselessly shot by a hanger-on. Warhol recovered, more cautious and more mellow, but the carefree days of smug spontaneity were over.

An Orientalist who helped establish the value of the art of Japan,

Singing in clubs and theaters in Indianapolis (his home town), New York, London, and Australia was exhilarating. Touring throughout the segregated South in the 1930's and 40's produced mortification and anger.
