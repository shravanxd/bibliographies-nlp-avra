I. WORKS EXCLUDED
To prevent this bibliography from growing so large that no press could afford to publish it, several classes of materials were excluded. These are:
A. Most episodic accounts such as those relating to Indian captivities mili- tary imprisonments overland” narratives, and escapes from slavery
B. Certain works in which the autobiographical element is insignificant, as is frequently true of stories of travel, exploration, sporting adventures, reminiscences of persons and of places, and of military history.
C. Also excluded were autobiographies in books of genealogy, manuscript auto¬ biographies, those appearing in newspapers or periodicals (unless independently re¬ printed), and those found in works of “collected” biography. Journals, diaries and collections of letters were not included.
D. Works known to be spurious.
E. Works commonly recognized as fictional even when the factual element is strong.
F. Works published after 1945.
II. WORKS INCLUDED
With regard to authors born in the United States who lived abroad, the decision was made to include their autobiographies. Also included were authors born out¬ side the United States who lived in this country for an appreciable period.
A large number of autobiographies have been ghost written, and on many an amanuensis was employed. These types have been included in this compilation.
I have sought within the means at my command to list every autobiography falling within the limits described in the preceding paragraphs. Despite the inevi¬ table omissions, here for the first time American autobiographies have been caught up in a comprehensive net.
III. EXPLANATION OF ENTRIES
Each entry normally contains these elements: name of the author, date of birth of the author; title; edition; place of publication; publisher; date of publication; pagination; name of library in which a copy can be found; and annotation.
A. Edition. No attempt was made to list more than a single edition, the one cited being the edition that could conveniently be found for description.
B. Publishers. No attempt was made to give the publishers exactly as found on the title pages of books. For reasons of economy, these usually have been cited in abbreviated form.
C. Pagination. No effort was made to cite preliminary pages of books. When¬ ever the autobiography does not comprise the whole of a book, the specific pages of autobiography have been indicated.
D. Location of Copies in Libraries. For each book there is shown the library in which the book was described. Naturally, some of these books are widely owned, and readers will find little difficulty in locating copies. Perhaps one-fourth, how¬ ever, are quite scarce and not easy to find.
Preceding the main list, the reader will find a guide to the abbreviations used

to indicate the libraries in which these books can be found.
E. Annotations. Each annotation contains the following ingredients: the occu¬ pation of the author; and the states in which he lived.
IV. SUBJECT INDEX
See the comments preceding the subject index.

Acknowledgments
I began to compile this bibliography in 1946.
My first move was to consult a large number of existing bibliographies, such as Streeter on Michigan, Work on the Negro, Publishers 5 Weekly. Evans, Sabin, and the Dictionary of American Biography.
In 1949, I spent five months in the states west of the Mississippi during which time I visited those libraries owning outstanding collections of Americana. This trip was made possible by the Committee on the Study of American Civilization (Rockefeller Foundation), and by the Research Committee of the Graduate School of the University of Wisconsin.
Before leaving for the West I had learned that Mr. Daniel C. Haskell had con¬ ceived the idea of a bibliography of American autobiographies owned by the New York Public Library, where he was then employed. Mr. Haskell, fortunately, agreed to join me in my efforts. Perhaps 15-per cent of the entries in this bibliography were subsequently supplied by him.
Upon my return from the West, Mr. Haskell, my wife Esther, and I fought our way through the printed author catalog of the Library of Congress.
At this point I should mention the start that had been made at the Library of Congress on a selective bibliography of American autobiographies. The fruits of this work were in 1947 made available to me, and I am happy to acknowledge this as sistance.
Between 1953 and 1956, I looked longingly towards libraries in the East but failed in my efforts to enlist further support from foundations. Then one happy day my good friend Cecil Byrd of Indiana advised me to appeal to Stanley Pargellis of the Newberry Library. This led to a grant of funds by the trustees of that library. With these funds Clinton Colby and then Jamies T. Cook were employed to inspect several thousand books at the Library of Congress, and the American Antiquarian Society. Upon Cook’s return from the East, the Research Committee of the Graduate School of the University of Wisconsin granted him a stipend enabling him to compile the subject index to this work.
I am indebted to many others. Several persons sent titles of books, and aided in describing them. These were Claude E. Spencer (Disciples of Christ Historical Society), Charles C. Ware (Christian Churches of North Carolina), Miss Valborg E. Bestul (Luther Theological Seminary, St. Paul), Edward Fortney (Drew Univers ity). Mrs. James Sterling and F. Clever Bald (Michigan Historical Collections), Miss Isabel Mayhew (University of Washington), Miss Mary Ogilvie (Swarthmore College), Niels H. Sonne (General Theological Seminary), Robert Dolliver (Methodist Histori¬ cal Society), Lewis O. Hartman (New England Conference Methodist Historical So¬ ciety), Miss Evalois St. John (Seventh Day Baptist Historical Society), Mrs. Sara Steele Hettinger (Juniata College), and Nelson P. Springer (Goshen College).
While in the West I met a number of book collectors, the memory of whose hospitality still warms the heart. These were David Duniway (Salem, Oregon), Robert A. Griffen (Reno, Nevada), Alexander Leggat (Butte, Montana),, and George Babbitt, Junior, (Flagstaff, Arizona).
Several hundred volumes, at my request were inspected and described in vari¬ ous libraries. I could not possibly list all these, but I do wish to acknowledge my debt to some more specifically. These were the Huntington Library, University of

Kentucky (especially Miss Norma Cass), Newberry Library, New York Public Li¬ brary, Library of Congress, University of North Carolina (especially Olan V. Cook), University of Texas, Western Reserve Historical Society, Boston Public Library, Yale University, and the National War College Library.
I wish also to thank Mr. Lloyd W. Griffin, my Humanities Reference Librarian, who helped with a number of knotty problems. And to my good friend William Matthews, of U.C.L.A., who turned out two while I was struggling with this one, many thanks for the numerous titles thrown my way.

A Note on the Subject Index
This index is designed to reveal the following: the occupations of the auto- oiographers; where they lived; and the important historical events (such as the Civil War) in which they played a part.
Some autobiographies do not lend themselves to identification by occupation, such as accounts of spiritual development, physical infirmity and mental illness. These are entered under appropriate headings, but unlike the occupational entries, are not further identified by place.
For the United States, the geographical divisions employed are those used by the Bureau of the Census. These are: Pacific, Mountain, East North Central, West North Central, South Atlantic, Middle Atlantic, New England, East South Central, and West South Central.
In addition to the designations described above, autobiographies are subdivided by periods (1800 — 1850, 1850 — 1900, etc.) No autobiography is entered under more than one of these periods.
To accommodate those interested in the history of immigrant groups, a special entry, Foreigners in the U.S.. has been made. This group is further subdivided un¬ der the names of the countries from which the immigrants came.
Autobiographies of Americans who lived abroad are entered under the names of the appropriate country. When several countries are involved, the name of the continent is substituted. Thus, for example, readers seeking European accounts, should refer also to the entries under Germany, France, etc.

BIBLIOGRAPHY OF AMERICAN AUTOBIOGRAPHIES
Compiled by Louis Kaplan and James T. Cook
A comprehensive compilation of more than 6,000 American autobiographies published from the colonial period to the year 1945. For each autobiography, there is given a brief statement of the author's main experience, the time in which he lived and the locale. In addition, there is provided a subject index of more than 20,000 entries through which research on many fronts can be pursued. Stu¬ dents of American history, politics, sociology, business, art, science, and literature will find this guide useful. Dr. Kaplan’s bibliography should serve to intensify the study of autobiographies as a form of literature, and as a clue to our history.
In the search for titles, many important libraries were visited, either by Dr. Kaplan or by one of his co-workers. The work resulting is the most comprehen¬ sive guide to American autobiographies ever attempted.
The senior compiler, Dr. Louis Kaplan, is Director of Libraries at the University of Wisconsin.

INDEXING YOUR BOOK: A Practical Guide for Authors By Sina Spiker
Authors indexing their own books will find useful pointers on the mechanics of indexing — on making slips, recording page numbers, and on preparing copy. Miss Spiker’s example of an analyzed entry of fifty-one items carried through from making the slips to typing the copy affords an excellent illustration of the princi¬ ples and procedures involved. A sample manuscript is included in the pamphlet to illustrate the author’s recommendations for the treatment of various in¬ dexing problems.
